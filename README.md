<h2>Introduction</h2>

Welcome to the Sticky Note project! 
Sticky Note is a small but practical project which can be used in Windows, Linux or macOS.

I used the Qt creator IDE to setup the project, due to its excellent internal build tools, especially for GUI. 

It has a variety of features such as:
* text alignment, left, right and center
* bold, strikethrough and underline text
* different font sizes and colors for each character
* save and settings buttons
* auto save and auto load the content


<h2>Requirements</h2>
Install qt framework on your system.

Use Qt creator or qt framework build system set up in your IDE.
